# Welcome to my projects

At YuJa, my guides are written and hosted in Zendesk. The guides here are recreated in Markdown using Docusaurus, with links to the originals on YuJa Support.

# What can you expect to find?

There are three types of guides you can browse in the navbar.

- **Product walkthrough:** See a sample of how I structure client-facing product guides.
- **How-to guide:** Step-by-step instructions for completing an LTI integration.
- **API reference:** Endpoints, parameters, and request/response examples for developers.
